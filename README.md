# P3-Image-Processing-Math-Game
Made in 2014, during 3rd semester of medialogy. The idea is a small game where children need to drag rotating orbs of numbers. The number they would need to drag would be shown with a plus or minus equation at the top of the scren. It requires the library OpenCV to run. Main takeaway from project is learning image processing. Picture of final project is shown below.
